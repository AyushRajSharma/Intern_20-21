1) Same question as this one [Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1367/problem/F2) but the input had distinct elements.(Medium-Hard)   
Solution : Use first array to index the elements of second array and then the ans is n-Longest increasing subseq with consecutive values.
2) Some dp question.(Medium)
3) A question based on trees with heavy implementation.(Medium)
4) Find size of set of intervals with minimum size such that each interval in the set intersects all other intervals.(Hard-Advanced)   
**1<=n<=1e5**     
Sol: I could only come up with an idea for n^2 solution where we could construct a graph with each interval being a node and edge between two intersecting intervals.   
However there could be a solution based on segtree with dp.

Only 10-15 people could solve more than 2 questions and only one managed to solve the 3rd question and no one could solve the 4th question,10 were shortlisted for the interviews

# Sprinklr 
1) Find number of Substrings with all distinct characters.(Easy-Medium)   
Sol: Two pointers
2) Given 3 aliens each having energy **e** and houses at n co-orinates on x-axis.If a alien is co-orinate (a,0) then it destories all the houses in range [a-e,a+e]
Find minimum energy required to destory all the houses.(Medium)   
Sol:Binary search the answer (note energy can be a fractional value)
3) Given a weighted graph and a number k we could change the weights of atmost k edges to zero independently for each destination vertex where the source being vertex 1.    
Find the length of the shortest paths form the source to all the destination vertices. (Hard)  
Constraints: **1<=n<=1e5 and k<=50**       
Sol:Modify dijsktra's algorithm and where dp[i][used] is distance of source form ith node when we have made values of "used" edges as zero.

Only 3-4 people managed to solve all the questions,18 were shortlisted for the interviews.

# DeShaw 
1) Basic mathematics question.(Cakewalk)
2) Find max value in a range. (Sparse Table / Segtree was to be used) (Easy-Medium)
3) Some question on lowerbound.(Cakewalk)

34 people managed to solve all the questions,34 were shortlisted for the interviews 

# Morgan stanley 
The test had 3 sections    
a) Quant (Mental ability questions like those in SOF olympiads there were 10 questions and time of 20 minutes)   
b) Debugging ( 7 questions with a time of 20 minutes.)   
c) Coding (3 questions in 60 minutes)   
1) Some basic maths question (Cakewalk)
2) [Question](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/pick-points-from-array-such-that-minimum-distance-is-maximized/amp/) based on Binary search the answer (Medium)
3) A complicated question where ultimately we had to find size of the convex hull of the given points.(Medium-Hard)   

Only 2 people managed to solve all the three questions of coding section,20-25 were shortlisted for the interviews.

# Quadeye

2) 8-10 mcqs related to quant
3) 2 HR questions
4) 2 coding questions 
    1) Given a string containing (, ), [, ], ? and '?' can be replaced by any character, find the number of ways in which the given string can be divided in two substrings such that all the brackets can be matched both the resulting substrings.  
    2) Given a die which can show values from 1 to m, find the number of ways to obtain a sum n.    
    
8 were shortlisted for the interviews (just the top 8 department ranks of CSE ,coding test was not considered for shortlisting) 

# Goldman Sachs
1) 2 coding questions(30 mins)
    1) Basic Greedy Question(Easy)
    2) Given a binary tree find the sum of all nodes whose left and right child are magic number.A number is a magic number if we can obtain 1 by repeatedly doing  sum of square of digits.(Medium)
